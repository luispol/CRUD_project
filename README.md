# CRUD_project
This project is about how to make a CRUD with JS, HTML and CSS, at the same time I use Node.js and some modules like: nodemon, mysql (for the connection of the data base), express, ejs (for the views). This CRUD is about users. Also I use some classes of Boostrapand sweet Alert for some dynamic messages.
